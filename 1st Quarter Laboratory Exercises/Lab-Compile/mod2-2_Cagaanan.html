			<h1> Brand New Animal (BNA) </h1>
			<p> Brand New ANimal or BNA for short is an Anime based on a world full of Humanoid Animals and Humas
			trying to co-exist. The huge problem in this Anime is the distrust between the two because of how
			Animals are seen as predators. Although they have created a city to seperate the two, problems still
			occurs. We watch the main character, Michiru, Find its way to cure her own unknown disease, finding
			other problems along the way and looking into the lives of the Anthropomorphic Animals. </p>
